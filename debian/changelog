xserver-xorg-input-vmmouse (1:12.6.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Robert Hooker ]
  * Pull from upstream master branch up to commit 833698b3b98
    - Fixed an issue where vmmouse was matched against the non-event device
      as well causing it to load multiple times and get stuck.
  * Version build-dependency on xutils-dev as it requires util-macros 1.4.

  [ Julien Cristau ]
  * Move vmmouse_detect from /usr/bin to /bin, since the udev rule needs it.
  * Stop shipping hal-probe-vmmouse.

xserver-xorg-input-vmmouse (1:12.5.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

    /usr/bin/Xorg and other modules, and that's not a bug, so we want
    dpkg-shlibdeps to shut up about symbols it can't find.
    + Build-depend on dpkg-dev >= 1.14.17.
