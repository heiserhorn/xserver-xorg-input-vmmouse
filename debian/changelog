xserver-xorg-input-vmmouse (1:12.6.3-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Drop patch vmmouse_scale_input_data.diff, it's been fixed upstream a while
    back.
  * Run autoreconf at build time.  Build-depend on automake, libtool and
    xutils-dev.
  * Handle parallel builds.
  * Install a detection program, a hal fdi file and a callout script for X
    input hotplug.  This closes: #509053, since the vmmouse no longer needs to
    be configured in xorg.conf.
  * Don't override the manpage suffix, it should be vmmouse(4) not
    vmmouse(4x).
  * Build against xserver 1.6 rc1.
  * Add myself to Uploaders.
  * Add Depends on xserver-xorg-input-mouse (closes: #509458)

xserver-xorg-input-vmmouse (1:12.5.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

xserver-xorg-input-vmmouse (1:12.5.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuild against xserver-xorg-dev 1.4.2 so that conversion_proc
    isn't called by both the driver and the server.

xserver-xorg-input-vmmouse (1:12.5.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    + Disable vmmouse_scale_input_data.diff since the corresponding
      upstream fix has been applied.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.7.3 (no changes).
  * Run dpkg-shlibdeps with --warnings=6.  Drivers reference symbols from
    /usr/bin/Xorg and other modules, and that's not a bug, so we want
    dpkg-shlibdeps to shut up about symbols it can't find.
    + Build-depend on dpkg-dev >= 1.14.17.
