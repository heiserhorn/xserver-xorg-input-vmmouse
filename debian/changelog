xserver-xorg-input-vmmouse (1:12.4.2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Julien Cristau ]
  * Add link to xserver-xorg-core bug script, so that bugreports contain
    the user's config and log files.
  * Generate the dependency on xserver-xorg-core automatically.

  [ Brice Goglin ]
  * New upstream release.
  * Drop 10_man_vmmouse_not_mouse, since upstream fixed the manpage.
  * Install the upstream changelog.
  * Bump Build-Depends: xserver-xorg-dev to >= 2:1.2.99.902
    (needed to let xsfbs get access to serverminver).

  * Add a link to www.X.org and a reference to the xf86-input-vmmouse
    module in the long description.
  * Add upstream URL to debian/copyright.
  * Build against xserver 1.4.
  * Generate the Provides field automatically.
  * Add myself to uploaders, and remove Branden with his permission.
