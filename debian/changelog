xserver-xorg-input-vmmouse (1:12.5.1-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    + Disable vmmouse_scale_input_data.diff since the corresponding
      upstream fix has been applied.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.7.3 (no changes).
  * Run dpkg-shlibdeps with --warnings=6.  Drivers reference symbols from
    /usr/bin/Xorg and other modules, and that's not a bug, so we want
    dpkg-shlibdeps to shut up about symbols it can't find.
    + Build-depend on dpkg-dev >= 1.14.17.
