 .SH DESCRIPTION
+.B vmmouse
+is the VMMouse driver enables support for the special VMMouse protocol
+that is provided by VMware virtual machines to give absolute pointer
+positioning.
+.PP
+Installing the driver will improve the user experience when using the
+mouse to interact with the guest operating system. In particular, use of
+the driver improves mouse "lag", provides mouse speed and acceleration
+consistent with the user's host operating system, and enables the
+auto-grab/ungrab feature in VMware products without requiring the VMware
+toolbox application.
+.PP
+Using it is simply a matter of changing the driver used for the 
+mouse input device from "mouse" to "vmmouse".
+.PP
+The vmmouse driver is capable of falling back to the standard "mouse"
+driver if a VMware virtual machine is not detected. This allows for
+dual-booting of an operating system from a virtual machine to real
+hardware without having to edit xorg.conf every time.
