    This reverts commit 93f032b80b841e1b6beeff814e8d9519e485fdef.
    
    I'm doing this for now because qemu (with and without kvm) provides
    an implementation of the vmmouse device and input hotplug works there
    right now. Later, I'll try and dig up an equivalent id check for them.

    Add HAL integration to support input hot plug.
    
     * vmmouse_detect: A simple program that detects whether a vmmouse
       device is present.
     * hal-probe-vmmouse: A HAL callout script that uses vmmouse_detect
       and overrides input.x11_driver.
     * 11-x11-vmmouse.fdi: fdi descriptor that adds the callout for PS/2
       mice.
    
    Additional 'configure' variables have been added to allow for overriding
    HAL paths, although this shouldn't usually be necessary.

    Don't call conversion_proc for older Xservers
    
    There was a bug in the Xserver for a while when it didn't call a driver's
    conversion_proc to convert device space coordinates to screen space. To fix
    this, vmmouse starting calling that method (since January), but if this is done
    on older versions of X, the conversion gets done twice.
    
    The fix is to add a configure check for the right versions of X and call
    VMMouseConvertProc() only if we are compiling against an X that has the bug.
    
    There's some whitespace cleanup for vmmouse.c too.

    - Makes the driver compile againt older versions of X (tested upto 4.3).
    - Bump up the version number in configure.ac and the modinfo section.
    - A couple of trivial whitespace cleanups.

    Fix device to screen space coordinate conversion
    
    The Xserver no longer calls an input device's conversion_proc to convert x and
    y coordinates from device to screen space. This fix calls the conversion
    routine in vmmouse.c before posting the motion event to Xserver.
    
    Other drivers also seem to rely on conversion_proc, so the real fix should probably
    go into Xserver's code (maybe in xserver/hw/xfree86/common/xf86Xinput.c?).

    Under certain circumstances, typically when the kernel PS/2 driver decides
    to reset the PS/2 device, we can find ourselves in an inconsistent state
    between the vmmouse driver and the virtual hardware. When this is encountered,
    we should re-request absolute mode from the hardware to get back in sync.
